# The Oak Restaurant Website :fork_and_knife:

-------------------------------- 

<b>SUMMARY</b>

-- The Oak is a fictional restaurant chain based in Washington D.C. Website is single-paged and it includes couple of sections with needed informations for new users (About, menu, contact, location etc.)

<b>FOCUS</b>

-- Focus was set on building responsive modern websites. The Oak website is just that. It is responsive and it uses all of the modern principles, including flat design (Simple layouts, simple colors..). It is optimized as well, which means that pictures are compressed and files (CSS & JS) are bundeled.

<b>TOOLS USED</b>

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Major flexbox + minor CSS Grid) + SASS
- JavaScript
- JSON (For managing packages and scripts AKA Dev Env.)
- NPM 
- Webpack (HTML,SCSS,IMG Plugins/Loaders + Babel)
- BEM Methodology

-- Note: Flexbox is used in almost every single layout/element on the website. Looking at responsiveness of the website, it just shows how good flexbox actually performs and does job the right way.
